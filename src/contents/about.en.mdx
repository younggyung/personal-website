I'm a frontend developer who enjoys creating user-friendly and meticulously crafted interfaces.  
I find the greatest fulfillment in designing and implementing experiences at the intersection of functionality and design.

I aim to go beyond what simply looks good, striving for implementations that also consider accessibility, performance, and maintainability.

When I'm not working, I usually spend time in nature, read good books, or enjoy quiet moments with a warm cup of tea.
